Developing-Data-Products-Project
================================
  
  This is the repository where the Developing Data Products Project assignment is located:
  
  The shiny application developed is a Calculator for the estimated increase in Miles per galon of a vehicule with Manual transmission instead of Automatic, as a function of HORSE POWER, or WEIGHT.
  
  The application uses data from the 'mtcars' dataset, and the computation (by mean of linear regression on the data) can be made for all cars, or filtering the data by engine type, number of cylinders, and/or number of gears. (since the dataset is small - all 3 gear vehicules are automatic, and all 5 gears are manual -  the computation is only possible with the options "4 gears" and "all")
  
  The aplication also plots the vehicules included in the selected filters.
  
The files of the applications are:
- ui.R
- server.R

The application is accesible at: https://joaoie.shinyapps.io/DataProductProject

A presentation of the application was also designed using RStudio Presenter. The presentation can be visualized at:
